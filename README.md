This is a simple, and my first todo app made with the BETH stack. Was nice being able to try out Bun and HTMX, I enjoyed working with them.

## Technologies Used
- Bun JS - Node JS but faster
- Elysia JS - Express JS but faster
- Turso - Edge Sqlite database
- HTMX - HTML with fancy attributes
- Drizzle ORM - Not as good as Prisma
-  HyperScript - Inline JS
-  TaileindCSS - Inline CSS
