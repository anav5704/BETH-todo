# BETH Stack To-Do App âœ…

![hero page](https://github.com/anav5704/BETH-todo/blob/main/docs/beth-todo.png)

This is a simple, and my first todo app made with the BETH stack. Was nice being able to try out Bun and HTMX, I enjoyed working with them. Yes, Bun add is way faster than npm install.

## Technologies Used

- HTMX 
- TailwindCSS 
- HyperScript 
- Bun JS 
- Elysia JS 
- Turso
- Drizzle ORM

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have ```bun``` installed. It is currently only on macOS and Linux, and if you're on Windows, you'll have to set up [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Once that is set up, fork and clone this repo. Then run ```bun install``` to install the dependencies. Now make a ```.env``` file in the root of your project and add the following variables:

```
DATABASE_URL
DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN
````

Finally, run ```bun start``` to view the project on localhost.
